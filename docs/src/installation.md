# Installation

NoLimits.jl requires Julia 1.10 or later. The package is currently installed directly from GitHub.

## Installing the Package

In a Julia session, run:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/<owner>/NoLimits.jl")
```

Then verify the installation by loading the package:

```julia
using NoLimits
```

If this runs without errors, the installation is complete and you are ready to proceed to the [Tutorials](tutorials/mixed-effects-multiple-methods.md).

## Registry Status

Registry-based installation (`Pkg.add("NoLimits")`) will be available once the package is published in a Julia package registry.
